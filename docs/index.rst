# Multiplatform Angular

Hi! It's d3sd1, project owner.
This project is based on the procedure write-once-compile-everywhere.
So, with one source code, you can compile it (for almost) any platform, including:

* Windows (x64 nor x32).
* MacOS.
* Linux (x64 nor x32).
* iOS.
* Android (x64 nor x32).

You can also build it from any host operating system, taking care about restrictions (detailed on every tutorial).
